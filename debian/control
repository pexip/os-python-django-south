Description: Intelligent schema migrations for django apps
 An intelligent database migrations library for the Django web framework.
 It is database-independent and DVCS-friendly, as well as a whole host of
 other features.
 .
  * Intelligent; it knows if you've missed out a migration or two
  * Database independent, so there's no hassle if you need to move databases.
  * Easy; it can write migrations for you, and it takes about a minute to
    convert your app over to use South.
  * Designed for a pluggable Django world; you can declare dependencies
    between apps so they all migrate together correctly, and you can
    still use syncdb for your non-migrated apps without it interfering.
